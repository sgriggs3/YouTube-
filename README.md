# YouTube Insight Analyzer

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to create a powerful tool for analyzing YouTube video data, providing insights into audience sentiment, engagement, and content themes. By leveraging advanced NLP techniques, data visualization, and a user-friendly web interface, this tool will enable users to gain a deeper understanding of their audience and content performance.

This project aims to go beyond basic sentiment analysis, incorporating features such as real-time comment analysis, support for multiple languages, keyword analysis, and the ability to compare different videos. It will also provide advanced data visualization capabilities, including interactive charts, heatmaps, word clouds, and sentiment distribution charts. The project will also include features to detect echo chambers, spam comments, and toxic comments, as well as the ability to summarize and translate comments.

Ultimately, this project will provide a comprehensive suite of tools for analyzing YouTube data, enabling users to make data-driven decisions about their content strategy and audience engagement.

## Examples of Advanced Data Analysis

Here are some examples of how the YouTube Insight Analyzer can be used in real-world scenarios:

1.  **Political Content Analysis:** Analyze comments on political videos to identify echo chambers and polarizing language. For example, you could compare the sentiment and themes in comments on videos from different political viewpoints to understand how opinions are formed and spread. You could also analyze the network of users commenting on the videos to detect echo chambers and measure the diversity of opinions.

2.  **Brand Monitoring:** Track sentiment and engagement on videos related to a specific brand or product. For example, you could analyze comments on product review videos to understand customer sentiment and identify areas for improvement. You could also analyze the keywords used in comments to understand what aspects of the product are most important to customers.

3.  **Content Strategy Optimization:** Analyze the performance of different types of videos to optimize content strategy. For example, you could compare the engagement metrics of different videos to understand what types of content resonate most with your audience. You could also analyze the sentiment and themes in comments to understand what aspects of the content are most engaging.

4.  **Trend Analysis:** Identify emerging trends and topics in YouTube comments. For example, you could analyze the keywords used in comments to identify emerging trends and topics. You could also analyze the sentiment and themes in comments to understand how opinions are changing over time.

5.  **Competitor Analysis:** Analyze the performance of competitor videos to identify best practices and opportunities. For example, you could compare the engagement metrics of your videos with those of your competitors to understand what they are doing well. You could also analyze the sentiment and themes in comments on competitor videos to understand what aspects of their content are most engaging.

6.  **Real-Time Event Analysis:** Analyze comments on live streams to understand audience sentiment and engagement in real-time. For example, you could analyze the sentiment of comments during a live event to understand how the audience is reacting to the event. You could also analyze the keywords used in comments to understand what aspects of the event are most engaging.

7.  **Audience Demographics Analysis:** Analyze the demographics of users commenting on videos to understand your audience better. For example, you could analyze the language and location of users commenting on your videos to understand your audience's demographics. You could also analyze the sentiment and themes in comments to understand how different demographic groups are reacting to your content.

8.  **Content Localization:** Analyze comments in different languages to understand how your content is received in different regions. For example, you could analyze the sentiment and themes in comments in different languages to understand how your content is received in different regions. You could also analyze the keywords used in comments to understand what aspects of your content are most important to different audiences.

9.  **Spam and Toxic Comment Detection:** Automatically detect and filter out spam and toxic comments. For example, you could use machine learning models to identify spam and toxic comments and automatically remove them from the comment section. You could also use sentiment analysis to identify comments that are likely to be toxic.

10. **Comment Summarization and Translation:** Summarize long comment threads and translate comments into different languages. For example, you could use natural language processing techniques to summarize long comment threads and translate comments into different languages. This would make it easier for users to understand the content of comments and participate in discussions.

These are just a few examples of how the YouTube Insight Analyzer can be used to gain valuable insights from YouTube data. The project is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing users to customize the analysis to meet their specific needs.

```python
def sentiment_trend_analysis(sentiment_data, output_file):
    sentiment_data['date'] = pd.to_datetime(sentiment_data['date'])
    fig = px.line(sentiment_data, x='date', y='sentiment', title='Sentiment Trend Analysis')
    fig.update_traces(hoverinfo='text+name', mode='lines+markers+text')
    fig.write_html(output_file)
```

This will generate a sentiment trend analysis chart and save it as an HTML file.

### Sentiment Distribution Analysis

To perform sentiment distribution analysis, use the following function in `data_visualization.py`:

```python
def sentiment_distribution_analysis(sentiment_data, output_file):
    fig = px.histogram(sentiment_data, x='sentiment', title='Sentiment Distribution Analysis')
    fig.write_html(output_file)
```

This will generate a sentiment distribution analysis chart and save it as an HTML file.

## Setting Up and Configuring the Project in GitHub Codespaces

### Prerequisites

1. **GitHub Account**: Ensure you have a GitHub account.
2. **Repository Access**: Ensure you have access to the repository where the project is hosted.

### Steps

1. **Open the Repository in GitHub Codespaces**:

   - Navigate to the repository on GitHub.
   - Click on the "Code" button and select "Open with Codespaces".
   - If you don't have a Codespace created, click on "New Codespace".

2. **Configure the Development Container**:

   - Ensure the repository contains a `devcontainer.json` file with the necessary configurations.
   - The `devcontainer.json` file should include the required extensions, settings, and Dockerfile for the development environment.

   Example `devcontainer.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "YouTube Insight Analyzer",
     "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/python:3.9",
     "settings": {
       "terminal.integrated.shell.linux": "/bin/bash"
     },
     "extensions": ["ms-python.python", "ms-toolsai.jupyter"],
     "postCreateCommand": "pip install -r requirements.txt",
     "remoteUser": "vscode"
   }
   ```

3. **Expose the Port in Codespaces**:

   - Open the "Ports" tab in the Codespaces interface.
   - Click on "Add Port" and enter the port number `8080`.
   - Ensure the port is set to be publicly accessible.

4. **Access the Application via HTTPS URL**:

   - After exposing the port, Codespaces will provide an HTTPS URL to access the application.
   - Open the provided HTTPS URL in your browser to access the YouTube Insight Analyzer.

5. **Verify the Setup**:

   - Ensure the front-end is installed and built, the backend is running, and the port is exposed in Codespaces.
   - Confirm that the provided HTTPS URL is accessible in the browser and the application is functioning correctly.
