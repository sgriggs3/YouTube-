# Cline Session 2 Instructions: Web UI Development

## Focus
This Cline session will focus on the web UI development of the YouTube Insight Analyzer project.

## Tasks
1.  **User Interface Design:**
    *   Design a clean and intuitive user interface.
    *   Create wireframes or mockups for the web pages.
    *   Use a suitable UI framework (e.g., React, Vue, Angular, or plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript).
    *   Ensure the UI is responsive and accessible.
2.  **User Authentication and Authorization (Optional):**
    *   Implement user registration and login functionality.
    *   Implement role-based access control (if needed).
    *   Secure user credentials and data.
3.  **Web Pages:**
    *   Create a page for entering YouTube video URLs.
    *   Create a page for displaying video metadata.
    *   Create a page for displaying sentiment analysis results.
    *   Create a page for displaying data visualizations.
    *   Create a configuration page for setting API keys and other settings.
    *   Use the `templates` directory to store the HTML files.
    *   Use the `webui.py` file to implement the web UI functionality.
4.  **API Integration:**
    *   Use JavaScript to make API calls to the backend.
    *   Display data received from the API in the UI.
    *   Handle API errors gracefully.

## Important Notes
*   Ensure that the UI is user-friendly and easy to navigate.
*   Coordinate with Cline session 1 to ensure that the web UI is compatible with the API endpoints.
*   Be aware of the testing and deployment tasks, but they are not the primary focus of this session.
