Important Issues:

1. Frontend webpack dependency conflict:
   - The frontend application failed to start due to a dependency conflict with webpack.
   - React-scripts requires webpack 4.29.6, but version 5.98.0 was detected, causing a conflict.
   - Resolution steps like deleting package-lock.json and node_modules and reinstalling dependencies did not resolve the issue.

2. Backend Python dependency issues:
   - The backend application failed to start due to missing Python modules (flask, numpy).
   - Attempting to install requirements using `pip install -r backend/requirements.txt` resulted in errors, specifically related to numpy and pkgutil.ImpImporter.
   - This indicates a problem with the Python environment setup or package compatibility.

3. Frontend TypeScript errors:
   - TypeScript errors are present in the frontend code, particularly in `ChatView.tsx`.
   - These errors are mostly related to module resolution and potentially incorrect import paths for shared modules.
   - Attempts to correct import paths were unsuccessful, suggesting a deeper issue with module configuration.

Limitations:

Due to these issues, I was unable to fully start and test the application to verify its functionality for YouTube URL input, comment scraping, CSV export, and sentiment analysis.

Recommendations:

- Resolve the Python backend dependency issues to ensure the backend application can start.
- Resolve the frontend webpack dependency conflict to ensure the frontend application can start.
- Investigate and fix the TypeScript configuration and module resolution issues in the frontend project.
- After resolving these issues, thoroughly test the application to ensure all features are working as expected.
