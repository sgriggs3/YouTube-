**URGENT ISSUES TO FIX**

1.  **`start_servers.sh` Script Failure:**
    *   **Description:** The script `./start_servers.sh` failed to execute, preventing access to the `webui` application via a remote URL. This is a critical issue as it blocks the completion of remote accessibility, UI/UX, and performance testing.
    *   **Impact:** Prevents the validation of the `webui` application, rendering the deployment validation incomplete.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   Examine the contents of `start_servers.sh` (if possible, I was unable to read the file).
        *   Identify the root cause of the script failure (e.g., missing dependencies, incorrect commands, permission issues).
        *   Correct the script and ensure it executes successfully.
        *   Obtain the remote URL.
2.  **Incomplete `webui` Application Testing:**
    *   **Description:** Due to the failure of the `start_servers.sh` script, the remote accessibility, UI/UX, and performance testing of the `webui` application could not be performed.
    *   **Impact:** Prevents the validation of the `webui` application's functionality and usability.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   Once the remote URL is available, perform the following tests:
            *   **Remote Accessibility:** Verify accessibility from diverse network locations and client devices.
            *   **UI/UX Testing:** Evaluate the UI/UX for usability, responsiveness, and adherence to design specifications.
            *   **Performance Testing:** Assess the `webui`'s performance under various load conditions.
