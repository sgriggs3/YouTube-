# GitHub Codespaces CPU Optimization Guide

## Overview
GitHub Codespaces may report 100% CPU utilization if background processes are running unnecessarily. Use the tips below to optimize performance.

## Recommendations
- **Stop Unneeded Processes:**  
  Identify and stop file watchers, debuggers, or build processes that are not required during certain development phases.

- **Adjust Log Levels:**  
  Use lower logging levels (e.g., ERROR) in production or resource-constrained environments to reduce CPU overhead.

- **Review Extensions:**  
  Disable VSCode extensions or plugins that may run resource-intensive background tasks.

- **Monitor Resource Usage:**  
  Use Codespaces’ built-in performance monitoring to pinpoint processes that consume excess CPU and consider restarting the Codespace once changes are applied.

## Commands and Checks
- Check running processes with system tools (e.g., `top` or VSCode’s process explorer).
- Pause/stop file watchers via your development tool configuration.

Following these steps should help mitigate high CPU utilization in your Codespace.
