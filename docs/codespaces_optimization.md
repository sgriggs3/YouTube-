# GitHub Codespaces CPU Optimization Guide

## Overview
GitHub Codespaces may report 100% CPU utilization if background processes are running unnecessarily. Use the tips below to optimize performance.

## Recommendations
- **Use Efficient Base Images:**  
  Choose minimal and efficient base images for your Dockerfiles to reduce resource consumption. For example, consider using `alpine` variants where possible:
  ```Dockerfile
  FROM node:14-alpine
  ```

- **Optimize Dockerfiles with Multi-Stage Builds:**  
  Implement multi-stage builds in Dockerfiles to keep the final image size small and efficient.  
  ```Dockerfile
  # Example of a multi-stage Dockerfile
  FROM node:14 AS builder
  WORKDIR /app
  COPY . .
  RUN npm install && npm run build

  FROM node:14-alpine
  WORKDIR /app
  COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
  CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
  ```

- **Leverage Prebuilds:**  
  Use prebuilds to prepare your development environment in advance, reducing the load during active development. Configure prebuilds in your repository settings to automate this process.

- **Configure Resource Limits:**  
  Set resource limits in your Docker configuration to prevent any single process from consuming all available CPU resources.  
  ```yaml
  # Example Docker Compose resource limits
  services:
    app:
      deploy:
        resources:
          limits:
            cpus: '0.5'
            memory: 512M
  ```

- **Stop Unneeded Processes:**  
  Identify and stop file watchers, debuggers, or build processes that are not required during certain development phases. For instance, disable hot-reloading in production environments.
  - **Step-by-Step Instructions:**
    1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
    2. Use system monitoring tools like `top` or `htop` to list running processes.
    3. Identify processes that are not essential for your current task.
    4. Use commands like `kill` or `pkill` to stop these processes.
    5. Verify that stopping these processes does not affect your workflow.

- **Adjust Log Levels:**  
  Use lower logging levels (e.g., ERROR) in production or resource-constrained environments to reduce CPU overhead.  
  ```javascript
  // Example of setting log level in Node.js
  const logger = require('winston');
  logger.level = 'error';
  ```
  - **Step-by-Step Instructions:**
    1. Open your application's configuration file.
    2. Locate the logging configuration section.
    3. Change the log level to `error` or `warn`.
    4. Save the changes and restart your application to apply the new log level.

- **Review Extensions:**  
  Disable VSCode extensions or plugins that may run resource-intensive background tasks. Regularly review and update extensions to ensure they are optimized.
  - **Step-by-Step Instructions:**
    1. Open VSCode and navigate to the Extensions view.
    2. Review the list of installed extensions.
    3. Disable or uninstall extensions that are not necessary for your current project.
    4. Regularly check for updates to ensure extensions are optimized.

- **Monitor Resource Usage:**  
  Use Codespaces’ built-in performance monitoring to pinpoint processes that consume excess CPU. Consider integrating additional monitoring tools like Prometheus or Grafana for more detailed insights.  
  ```yaml
  # Example Prometheus configuration
  scrape_configs:
    - job_name: 'codespaces'
      static_configs:
        - targets: ['localhost:9090']
  ```
  - **Step-by-Step Instructions:**
    1. Access the Codespaces performance monitoring dashboard.
    2. Identify processes with high CPU usage.
    3. Investigate these processes to determine if they are necessary.
    4. Use additional tools like Prometheus for detailed monitoring.

- **Regular Updates:**  
  Regularly update your development environment and tools to incorporate new best practices and optimizations. Set up automated dependency updates using tools like Dependabot.

## Commands and Checks
- Check running processes with system tools (e.g., `top` or VSCode’s process explorer).
- Pause/stop file watchers via your development tool configuration.

Following these steps should help mitigate high CPU utilization in your Codespace.
