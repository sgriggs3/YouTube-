# GitHub Codespaces CPU Optimization Guide

## Overview
GitHub Codespaces may report 100% CPU utilization if background processes are running unnecessarily. Use the tips below to optimize performance.

## Recommendations
- **Use Efficient Base Images:**  
  Choose minimal and efficient base images for your Dockerfiles to reduce resource consumption. For example, consider using `alpine` variants where possible:
  ```Dockerfile
  FROM node:14-alpine
  ```

- **Optimize Dockerfiles with Multi-Stage Builds:**  
  Implement multi-stage builds in Dockerfiles to keep the final image size small and efficient.  
  ```Dockerfile
  # Example of a multi-stage Dockerfile
  FROM node:14 AS builder
  WORKDIR /app
  COPY . .
  RUN npm install && npm run build

  FROM node:14-alpine
  WORKDIR /app
  COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
  CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
  ```

- **Leverage Prebuilds:**  
  Use prebuilds to prepare your development environment in advance, reducing the load during active development. Configure prebuilds in your repository settings to automate this process.

- **Configure Resource Limits:**  
  Set resource limits in your Docker configuration to prevent any single process from consuming all available CPU resources.  
  ```yaml
  # Example Docker Compose resource limits
  services:
    app:
      deploy:
        resources:
          limits:
            cpus: '0.5'
            memory: 512M
  ```

- **Stop Unneeded Processes:**  
  Identify and stop file watchers, debuggers, or build processes that are not required during certain development phases. For instance, disable hot-reloading in production environments.

- **Adjust Log Levels:**  
  Use lower logging levels (e.g., ERROR) in production or resource-constrained environments to reduce CPU overhead.  
  ```javascript
  // Example of setting log level in Node.js
  const logger = require('winston');
  logger.level = 'error';
  ```

- **Review Extensions:**  
  Disable VSCode extensions or plugins that may run resource-intensive background tasks. Regularly review and update extensions to ensure they are optimized.

- **Monitor Resource Usage:**  
  Use Codespaces’ built-in performance monitoring to pinpoint processes that consume excess CPU. Consider integrating additional monitoring tools like Prometheus or Grafana for more detailed insights.  
  ```yaml
  # Example Prometheus configuration
  scrape_configs:
    - job_name: 'codespaces'
      static_configs:
        - targets: ['localhost:9090']
  ```

- **Regular Updates:**  
  Regularly update your development environment and tools to incorporate new best practices and optimizations. Set up automated dependency updates using tools like Dependabot.

## Commands and Checks
- Check running processes with system tools (e.g., `top` or VSCode’s process explorer).
- Pause/stop file watchers via your development tool configuration.

Following these steps should help mitigate high CPU utilization in your Codespace.
