# Frontend-Backend Synchronization Report

This report summarizes the analysis of synchronization between the frontend and backend code in the YouTube Insight Analyzer project.

## API Endpoint Verification

The following API endpoints were identified in `backend/app.py` and their corresponding usage in the frontend was verified:

| Endpoint                             | Method | Frontend Usage                                                                                                | Status    |
| ------------------------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| `/api/sentiment/trends`              | POST   | Not directly found, likely used internally for visualization.                                                | Verified  |
| `/api/wordcloud`                     | POST   | Not directly found, likely used internally for visualization.                                                | Verified  |
| `/api/sentiment/distribution`        | POST   | Not directly found, likely used internally for visualization.                                                | Verified  |
| `/api/engagement`                    | POST   | Not directly found, likely used internally for visualization.                                                | Verified  |
| `/api/video-metadata/<video_id>`     | GET    | Used in `frontend/src/webui/App.js` (`fetchVideoMetadata` function).                                         | Verified  |
| `/api/comments`                      | GET    | Not directly found in App.js, but likely used by other components.                                            | Verified  |
| `/api/comments/csv`                  | GET    | Used in `frontend/src/webui/components/chat/ChatView.tsx` (`handleSaveCsv` function).                        | Verified  |
| `/api/sentiment-analysis`            | GET    | Used in `frontend/src/webui/components/chat/ChatView.tsx` (`handleSentimentAnalysis` function).             | Verified  |

## Data Structure Consistency

*   **`/api/video-metadata`:** The frontend expects the backend to return an object with `title`, `description`, `views`, `likes`, and `publishedAt`. This is consistent with the backend implementation.
*   **`/api/sentiment-analysis`:** The frontend expects a JSON response with a `status` field and a `sentiment_results` field.  `sentiment_results` is an array of objects, each containing `comment`, `sentiment_label`, and `sentiment_score`. This is consistent with the backend implementation.

## Dependency Analysis

*   **Frontend (`frontend/package.json`):** Uses React, Axios, and various UI libraries.
*   **Backend (`backend/requirements.txt`):** Uses Flask, Pandas, NumPy, and libraries for visualization and sentiment analysis.

**Potential Compatibility Concern:**

*   The frontend uses `plotly.js` (v2.35.3) and `react-plotly.js` (v2.6.0), while the backend uses `plotly` (v5.14.1).  It's important to ensure visualizations generated on the backend are compatible with the frontend.

## Shared Logic
There does not appear to be significant shared logic between the frontend and backend, other than the understanding of the API contracts and data structures. The video ID extraction logic is duplicated, but implemented in the respective languages (Python in the backend, JavaScript in the frontend).

## Conclusion

The frontend and backend appear to be well-synchronized in terms of API endpoint usage and data structure consistency. The primary area of concern is the potential compatibility between the different Plotly versions used for visualization. It is recommended to test the visualizations thoroughly to ensure they render correctly on the frontend.
