# Deployment Guide for YouTube Insight Analyzer

This guide explains how to deploy both the backend and frontend applications along with suggestions for best practices.

## Backend Deployment

1. **Prepare the Environment**  
   - Install required Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file.  
     `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
   - Set environment variables (e.g., API keys, configuration options) using a `.env` file if needed.

2. **Configure Production Settings**  
   - Disable debug mode.  
   - Use a production-ready web server such as Gunicorn (with Hypercorn for Quart, if required).  
   - Ensure CORS and compression are properly configured.

3. **Logging & Error Monitoring**  
   - Configure logging for error monitoring.
   - Optionally, integrate with a service like Sentry for real-time error tracking.

4. **Starting the Server**  
   - Run the backend with:
     ```
     gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 backend.app:app
     ```
   - Alternatively, if using Hypercorn for a Quart version:
     ```
     hypercorn backend.app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:5000
     ```

## Frontend Deployment

1. **Setup and Build**  
   - Navigate to the frontend directory.
   - Install dependencies:
     ```
     npm install
     ```
   - Build the project for production:
     ```
     npm run build
     ```

2. **Serving the Frontend**  
   - Serve static files using a web server (e.g., Nginx) or use a hosting service (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).
   - Ensure the built assets are correctly referenced in your application.

3. **Integration with Backend**  
   - Update API endpoint URLs in the frontend configuration if needed.
   - Consider using environment-specific configuration files.

## General Suggestions

- **Testing:** Implement unit/integration tests for both backend and frontend before deploying.
- **Security:**  
  - Secure API keys and credentials.  
  - Use HTTPS for secure communication.
- **Monitoring:** Employ monitoring tools to track performance and issues.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automate tests and deployment using services like GitHub Actions, Travis CI, or others.
- **Documentation:** Maintain up-to-date documentation alongside your deployment guide.
- **Codespaces Note:** In a Codespace environment, stop or pause nonessential processes (e.g., automatic file watchers) to reduce CPU load for a smoother experience.

Happy Deploying!
