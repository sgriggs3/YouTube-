Project Plan: Optimize Workflow, Analyze Issues, Implement Logging and Error Handling

1. Backend Analysis and Optimization:
    - Review backend/app.py for architecture, potential issues, and areas for improvement.
    - Check backend/requirements.txt for dependencies and potential conflicts.
    - Implement logging in backend/app.py to track requests, responses, and errors.
    - Implement error handling in backend/app.py to catch exceptions and return informative error messages.

2. Frontend Analysis and Optimization:
    - Review frontend/src/App.js and other relevant frontend files to understand the structure and identify potential issues.
    - Analyze frontend/package.json for dependencies and potential conflicts.
    - Implement frontend error handling to catch JavaScript errors and display user-friendly messages or log errors to the console.
    - Optimize frontend build process and identify potential performance bottlenecks.

3. Workflow Optimization:
    - Define the fastest workflow for local development, testing, and deployment.
    - Document the workflow in this project_plan.txt file, including commands and steps for each stage.
    - Ensure the workflow includes steps for running backend and frontend tests (if available).

4. Logging and Error Handling Implementation Details:
    - Backend Logging: Use Python's logging module to log events at different levels (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR). Log to console and potentially to a file for persistent logs.
    - Frontend Logging: Use console.error() for basic error logging. Consider integrating a more advanced logging library for production applications.
    - Error Handling: In both frontend and backend, implement try-except blocks to catch exceptions. Return appropriate error responses to the frontend and log detailed error information in the backend.

5. Documentation and Review:
    - Update README.md with the optimized workflow and instructions for setting up logging and error handling.
    - Review the implemented changes and ensure they meet the project requirements and best practices.

Order of Execution:
    - Backend Analysis and Optimization
    - Frontend Analysis and Optimization
    - Workflow Optimization
    - Logging and Error Handling Implementation Details
    - Documentation and Review

Logs and Error Handling Goals:
    - Faster issue fixing by providing detailed logs of application behavior.
    - Improved application stability and user experience through robust error handling.
    - Easier debugging and maintenance in the long run.
