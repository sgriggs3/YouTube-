# Tasks Finished

## Backend Development

### YouTube API Integration
- Implemented functions to fetch video metadata, comments, and transcripts.
- Added caching and retry logic for API requests.
- Improved error handling and logging.

### Sentiment Analysis
- Implemented sentiment analysis using VADER and HuggingFace transformers.
- Added preprocessing steps for comments, including tokenization, stop-word removal, and lemmatization.
- Implemented functions to categorize comments by themes and analyze sentiment trends.
- Added toxicity detection using the toxic-bert model.

### Data Visualization
- Created functions to generate heatmaps, word clouds, and sentiment distribution charts.
- Integrated data visualizations into the web UI.

### Data Storage
- Implemented functions to store and retrieve data in CSV and JSON formats.
- Added support for loading and saving configuration settings.

### API Endpoints
- Created API endpoints for fetching video metadata, comments, transcripts, and sentiment analysis results.
- Implemented proper error handling and response codes.

## Web UI Development

### User Interface Design
- Designed a clean and intuitive user interface using Flask and Plotly.
- Created pages for video analysis, configuration, and data visualization.

### API Integration
- Integrated the web UI with the backend API to display data.
- Added forms for user input and feedback.

## Testing and Deployment

### Unit and Integration Tests
- Wrote unit tests for individual functions and components.
- Wrote integration tests to ensure different parts of the system work together correctly.
- Achieved high test coverage.

### Deployment
- Configured the application for deployment.
- Deployed the application and monitored for errors and performance issues.

## Issues and Improvements

### Issues
- Some API requests may still hit rate limits despite retry logic.
- Sentiment analysis accuracy can be improved with more advanced models.
- Real-time visualization may have performance issues with large datasets.

### Improvements
- Implement exponential backoff and use multiple API keys to handle rate limits more effectively.
- Fine-tune sentiment analysis models on a labeled dataset of YouTube comments.
- Optimize data visualization for performance with large datasets.
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data to reduce redundant computations.

## Future Work
- Implement real-time comment analysis.
- Add support for multiple YouTube channels.
- Implement keyword analysis and topic modeling.
- Add features to export analysis results and generate reports.
- Enhance user feedback mechanisms and incorporate feedback into sentiment analysis models.
- Expand the system to work with other social media platforms.
