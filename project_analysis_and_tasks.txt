Working Features:

Backend:
- Basic Flask API setup and routing.
- Fetching video metadata from YouTube API.
- Scraping video comments from YouTube API.
- Generating CSV of comments.
- Optimized backend deployment by adding logging configuration in app.py.
- Implemented sentiment_analysis.py using VADER to correctly return analysis results.
- Created webui.py to serve as the launcher for the Flask app.

Frontend:
- Basic React application structure.
- Chat interface for user interaction.
- Displaying video metadata.
- Scraping and displaying comments.
- Basic progress indication and error handling.
- "Save CSV" button (functional).
- "Sentiment Analysis" button (triggers backend call, but no result display yet).

Features to Implement (New Tasks):

1. Implement Sentiment Analysis:
    - Implement actual sentiment analysis logic in the backend (`backend/app.py`, `sentiment_analysis.py`) using NLP libraries (nltk, vaderSentiment).
    - Create a function in `sentiment_analysis.py` to perform sentiment analysis on comment text.
    - Integrate this function into the `/api/sentiment-analysis` endpoint in `backend/app.py`.
    - Update `AnalysisView.tsx` to display sentiment analysis results (comment-level sentiment).

2. Integrate Data Visualizations:
    - Examine backend visualization functions in `data_visualization.py`.
    - Determine how to serve visualization files (`.html`, `.png`) to the frontend.
    - Update `AnalysisView.tsx` to fetch and display visualizations generated by the backend (sentiment trends, distribution, word cloud, engagement).
    - Consider using iframes or embedding libraries to display visualizations in `AnalysisView`.

3. Enhance YouTube URL Handling:
    - Ensure YouTube URL input in `ChatView` is consistently used for all relevant backend API calls (metadata, comments, analysis, visualizations).
    - Update frontend and backend to properly extract video IDs from URLs and handle both video IDs and URLs as input.

4. Improve Error Handling and User Feedback:
    - Implement comprehensive error handling in both frontend and backend for API calls, data processing, and visualization generation.
    - Display user-friendly error messages in the frontend using VSCode UI elements (e.g., error toasts, status bar messages).
    - Add loading states and progress indicators for all long-running operations (scraping, analysis, visualization).

5. Enhance UI/UX:
    - Review the UI/UX of `ChatView` and `AnalysisView`.
    - Implement UI improvements to make the application more user-friendly and visually appealing (e.g., better layout, styling, responsiveness).
    - Consider using a UI library or component library for consistent styling and components.

6. Implement Testing:
    - Write unit tests for backend functions (e.g., sentiment analysis, data visualization, API calls).
    - Write integration tests for backend API endpoints.
    - Write component tests for frontend components (`ChatView`, `AnalysisView`, etc.).
    - Set up a testing framework and CI/CD pipeline for automated testing.

7. Explore MCP Integration:
    - Investigate potential use cases for MCP servers to extend application capabilities (e.g., integrating with other APIs, services, or tools).
    - If applicable, design and implement MCP server integration for relevant features.

Deployment Tasks:
- Ensure environment variables are set and secrets managed.
- Use a production-ready web server (e.g., Gunicorn with Hypercorn for Quart).
- Set host to 0.0.0.0 and disable debug mode.
- Configure CORS and compression for production.
- Setup logging and error monitoring.
- Final end-to-end tests of API and UI endpoints.

Next Steps:
- Add unit and integration tests.
- Optimize performance and security settings.
- Updated project-level requirements.txt with necessary Python packages.

## Codespaces CPU Optimization Tasks
- Identify long-running background processes (e.g., file watchers) and disable or stop them when not developing.
- Configure log levels and disable extra debug output in production environments.
- Use the profile tools provided by Codespaces to pinpoint inefficient processes.
- Consider restarting the Codespace when switching contexts.
