# Optimized Task Workflow for YouTube Insight Analyzer

This workflow outlines the steps for developing, testing, and deploying the YouTube Insight Analyzer project.

## 1. Project Setup and Initialization

- **1.1. Create Virtual Environment (Backend):**
  - Navigate to the `backend` directory: `cd backend`
  - Create a Python virtual environment: `python3 -m venv venv`
  - Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
- **1.2. Install Backend Dependencies:**
  - Navigate to the `backend` directory: `cd backend`
  - Install Python dependencies from `requirements.txt`: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **1.3. Install Frontend Dependencies:**
  - Navigate to the `frontend` directory: `cd frontend`
  - Install Node.js dependencies: `npm install`

## 2. Development

- **2.1. Backend Development:**
  - Navigate to the `backend` directory: `cd backend`
  - Start the Flask development server: `python app.py` 
  - (or using module: `python -m backend.app`)
  - Access backend API endpoints at `http://localhost:5000/api/...`
- **2.2. Frontend Development:**
  - Navigate to the `frontend` directory: `cd frontend`
  - Start the React development server: `npm start`
  - Access frontend UI at `http://localhost:3000` (or as specified by `react-scripts`)
- **2.3. Combined Development (Frontend & Backend):**
  - In project root, run: `npm run start:dev` 
  - This uses `concurrently` to start both frontend and backend dev servers.

## 3. Testing

- **3.1. Backend Testing:**
  - Navigate to the `backend/tests` directory: `cd backend/tests`
  - Run backend tests (using pytest or unittest - check project setup): `pytest` (or `python -m unittest discover`)
- **3.2. Frontend Testing:**
  - Navigate to the `frontend` directory: `cd frontend`
  - Run frontend tests (using Jest/React Testing Library - check `frontend/package.json`): `npm test`

## 4. Building for Production

- **4.1. Build Frontend:**
  - Navigate to the `frontend` directory: `cd frontend`
  - Create a production build of the React app: `npm run build`
  - Output will be in `frontend/build` directory.
- **4.2. Package Backend (if needed):**
  - For deployment, you might need to package the backend application (e.g., using Docker, or creating a distributable package). Refer to deployment documentation.

## 5. Deployment

- **5.1. Deploy Backend:**
  - Choose a deployment platform (e.g., AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku, Google Cloud App Engine, serverless functions).
  - Deploy the Flask backend application. 
  - Configure environment variables (e.g., YouTube API keys, database connection strings).
- **5.2. Deploy Frontend:**
  - Choose a static hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, AWS S3, GitHub Pages).
  - Deploy the contents of the `frontend/build` directory to the hosting service.
  - Configure API endpoint URLs in the frontend to point to the deployed backend.

## 6. Task Automation (using scripts - future enhancement)

- Identify repetitive tasks (e.g., data collection, analysis, report generation).
- Create Python or shell scripts for these tasks.
- Document scripts in `DEPLOY_GUIDE.md`.
- Potentially automate script execution using GitHub Actions or Codespaces lifecycle events.

## 7. GitHub Codespaces Optimization (refer to project_analysis.txt and DEPLOY_GUIDE.md)

- Ensure proper `devcontainer.json` and prebuild configurations for faster Codespaces setup.
- Integrate automated testing into Codespaces prebuilds.
- Document Codespaces-specific setup and automation in `DEPLOY_GUIDE.md`.

## 8. Error Handling and Debugging (refer to DEPLOY_GUIDE.md)

- Review implemented error handling in backend and frontend.
- Implement further error handling and logging as needed.
- Utilize debugging tools and techniques for backend (Flask debugger, logging) and frontend (browser developer tools, React DevTools).

## 9. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD - future enhancement)

- Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or other CI/CD tools.
- Automate build, test, and deployment processes.

This workflow provides a structured approach to developing, testing, and deploying the YouTube Insight Analyzer. Adapt and expand upon this workflow as the project evolves.
